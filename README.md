Table: track id, track name, and number of appearances in playlists
This is done by counting the number of tracks in playlist_track and grouped by track id

2. Top 10 tracks that generated the most revenue
Table: track id, track name, revenue by track
This is done by summing the unit prices of each track appeared in invoice_items and grouped by track id

3. Top 10 genres that generated the most revenue

6. Number of customers each support employee supported
Table: employee id, employee first name, employee last name, number of customers supported
This is done by matching the employee id with the support rep id and counting the number of times they appeared

7. Average revenue of each sale

This is done by finding the average revenue amongst 4 sales employees, and attributing this number to each sales employee

8. Total sale
Table: total sale

9. Do longer or shorter length albums tend to generate more revenue?
Longer
Table: album id, album title, album length (in milliseconds), revenue by album
This is done by finding the length of each album, and finding the revenue each album generated

10.Is the number of times a track appear in any playlist a good indicator of sales?
No, some tracks appeared in 5 playlists, but did not generate more revenue than those appearing in 2
Table: track id, track name, track appearance number, revenue by track
This is done by finding the number of times a track has appeared in a playlist, then finding the revenue generated by that track

11. How much revenue is generated each year, and what is its percent change from the previous year
Table: Year, Revenue by year, percentage growth from previous year
This is done by finding the revenue generated each year, then calculating the percentage growth
